# ðŸŒ¾ Wheat Yield Prediction & Analysis

This project explores wheat genotype characteristics using **Data Visualization** and **Machine Learning** to predict grain yield.  
It combines statistical analysis, supervised learning, and clustering to generate insights that could support agricultural decision-making.


## ðŸ“Š Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature selection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and genotype comparisons.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - K-Means Clustering to group genotypes by performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score, and visual comparison of predictions.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset includes **Spikelet count, Grain number, Grain yield, and Genotype** parameters.  
- If small, it is included in `/data/dvpcsv.csv`.  
- If not, download it from [link/to/dataset] and place it in a `/data` folder.
